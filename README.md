# 8 Week SQL Challenge   

This repository contains my solutions for the SQL case studies from the #8WeekSQLChallenge. I have used MySQL Workbench for quering and retrieving data.

By solving these case studies, I have improved my technical SQL skills and also on how to tackle and solve a given question.  

I would like to thank Mr. Danny Ma - [Data with Danny](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datawithdanny/) for providing such interesting case studies.
