## Problem Statement:

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”    

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine 
with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!    

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay 
freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## Project Description:   

For solving these questions, I have used SQL (Structured Query Language). I have used MySQL Workbench to answer these questions and came up with valuable insights which could help the business to take better data-driven decisions.   

## What I have learned by doing this project:  

1)	creating new tables and inserting data into them  
2)	creating temporary tables  
3)	data cleaning and transformation:  
a)	replacing blank spaces and null values  
b)	removing unwanted strings/text from certain columns using regular expressions and replacing with appropriate values

c)	changing  columns with text data type to float data type  
5)	Concepts I have used in the project:   
a)	CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, IF EXISTS  
b)	DISTINCT, DISTINCTCOUNT, ALIAS, LIKE, AGGREGATE functions (SUM, MIN, MAX, COUNT), WHERE (filtering data), Logical AND, DATE and TIME functions  
c)	INNER JOINs, Multiple INNER JOINs, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT  
d)	Common Table Expression (CTE) and CASE statement
